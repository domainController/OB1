In Swedish legal practice, formal procedure often outweighs the substance of a case. While procedural protections are essential, they can also serve as a veil — protecting employers from scrutiny while obscuring the reality faced by precarious workers.

In many employment disputes, courts and institutions focus on _form_: whether the employee resigned correctly, whether deadlines were met, whether the employer followed the right channels. But this focus can easily become a tactic — a way to avoid engaging with the core issue: abuse, exploitation, or wage theft.

This note explores how “form over substance” plays out in practice and offers guidance on how workers can protect themselves from procedural traps. It is based on lived experience, HRAK disputes, and specific cases in the restaurant sector.
