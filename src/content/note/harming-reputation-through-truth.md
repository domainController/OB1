Can someone harm the reputation of a company â€” legally?

**Yes**, if it is done:

- through **verifiable facts**,
- with a **public interest justification**,
- and expressed in a **measured, responsible tone**.

Swedish law (Brottsbalken 5 kap.) prohibits _fÃ¶rtal_ (defamation), but only under specific conditions:

- **False statements**, or
- **Unnecessary exposure of private matters**, or
- **Disproportionate language or accusations**.

ðŸ§­ This note serves as a guide for anyone sharing sensitive but truthful material.  
Naming a business (like **QUAN**) is **not defamatory** if:

- You were employed or engaged there.
- You provide contextual documents (plannings, pay slips, etc.).
- You focus on facts, not insults or assumptions.

If your intent is **to document**, **to warn**, or **to engage public scrutiny**,  
then you are exercising **your right to freedom of expression**.

**You may influence reputation** â€”  
but if what you report is **accurate and of societal value**, it is **lawful and protected**.
