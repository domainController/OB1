## What is an employment contract in Sweden?

In Sweden, a job contract **does not need to be written to be valid**. It can be **oral, tacit, or written**, as long as a few key conditions are met.

According to Swedish labour law (Arbetsr√§tt), a contract exists when a person works **in exchange for compensation**, under the **authority and direction** of an employer. This hierarchical relationship is key to establishing an employment situation.

## How can a contract be proven without a written document?

Even without a signed contract, the following elements may serve as **evidence**:

- Payslips or bank transfers
- Work schedules or shift confirmations (SMS, apps like _Personalkollen_)
- Uniforms, access badges, or equipment provided by the employer
- Witness statements or messages with supervisors

These can help demonstrate an **implicit employment agreement**, even in court.

## Why a written contract still matters

Although not mandatory, having a written contract provides **critical protection**, especially in case of conflict:

- It proves the **scope of your job**, the **hours**, and **agreed wage**
- It helps prevent being classified as ‚Äúextra‚Äù or casual labour without rights
- It secures your position in case of **wrongful dismissal**

## What should a written contract include?

The Swedish Employment Protection Act (LAS) states a contract should contain:

- Names of employer and employee
- Start date of employment
- Role or job title
- Workplace location
- Salary and payment frequency
- Weekly working hours
- Conditions of termination or trial period

The employer is legally required to **provide these in writing within 7 days** from the first day of work ‚Äî even if no signed paper is issued.

## In case of dispute or missing contract

Employees can:

- Contact their **union** (HRF for restaurant workers)
- Request **free legal advice** from local support services
- Report to the **Work Environment Authority** (Arbetsmilj√∂verket)
