## Definition

**OB-tillägg** (short for _obekväm arbetstid_) refers to **supplemental pay** granted to employees who work during "inconvenient" or **unsocial hours** — typically evenings, nights, weekends, and public holidays. The term is **specific to the Swedish labour context** and is widely used in employment contracts and collective agreements (_kollektivavtal_).

---

## Legal Status

OB-tillägg is **not mandated by statutory law**, meaning it is **not found in the Swedish Employment Protection Act (LAS)** or in general labour codes.  
Instead, it is governed by **collective agreements** between employer organizations and trade unions.

> ⚠️ Employers who do not follow a collective agreement **are not obligated by law** to pay OB-tillägg, unless specified in the employment contract.

---

## Common Sectors

The concept is **widely applied** in industries where shift work is common, including:

- 🍽️ Hospitality (restaurants, hotels, cafés)
- 🏥 Healthcare (hospitals, elderly care)
- 🛒 Retail (grocery stores, malls)
- 🚛 Transportation and logistics
- 🧹 Cleaning services

---

## Time Frames (Gröna Riksavtalet – Hospitality)

Under the **Green National Agreement (Gröna Riksavtalet)** for the hospitality sector, the qualifying hours are typically:

- **Weekdays (Mon–Fri):** 20:00–06:00
- **Saturdays, Midsummer Eve, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve:** 16:00–06:00
- **Sundays and Public Holidays:** 06:00–06:00 (next day)

These ranges may vary slightly depending on updates to agreements.

---

## Compensation Levels

Rates are **entirely determined by the collective agreement**. Example (2024 values, SLU public sector):

- **OB 1 (Simple OB):** min. SEK 37/hour
- **OB 2 (Qualified OB):** min. SEK 75/hour
- **OB 3 (Double Qualified OB):** min. SEK 145/hour

The higher the OB category, the more "inconvenient" the hours are deemed to be.

## OB Categories Explained

| Category | Typical Use                      | Example Time           |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| OB 1     | Evening / early night work       | Weekdays after 20:00   |
| OB 2     | Late night / Saturday / holidays | Sat 16:00 to Sun 06:00 |
| OB 3     | Major public holidays, Sundays   | Christmas, Midsummer   |

---

## Payslip Visibility

OB-tillägg must appear as **separate line items** on payslips when paid. Example:

```
OB 1 Evening Hours       12 hrs x 37.00  = SEK 444.00
OB 2 Weekend Night       6 hrs x 75.00   = SEK 450.00
```

If OB is included in a flat hourly rate without being itemized, **this may be contested**.

---

## Compliance & Abuse

- ❌ **Not always respected** in non-unionized restaurants.
- 🧾 Workers often discover **OB missing** on payslips or only partially paid.
- 📢 Trade unions may intervene, especially in hospitality, to retroactively claim OB pay.

---

## Jurisprudence

While OB-tillägg is **not statutory**, it has been mentioned in **labour court cases (Arbetsdomstolen)** as a basis for assessing **fair compensation**.

Case examples may include:

- AD 2018 nr 51: Compensation for unpaid OB hours due to misclassified contract
- AD 2021 nr 11: Dispute over whether OB 2 applies to Midsummer Eve

---

## Summary

OB-tillägg is a **core economic right** for Swedish shift workers. While not statutory, it is **quasi-obligatory** in all unionized sectors and widely enforced. Dishwashers, servers, and cleaners should always verify:

1. Their hours of work
2. The applicable OB categories
3. That OB appears on each payslip
4. Whether their employer follows a collective agreement
