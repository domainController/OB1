### Three weeks at Quan — without a contract

Between **November 23 and December 15, 2024**, I worked as a **dishwasher** in a restaurant located in Malmö — the establishment is named **Quan**.

My shifts were assigned in advance, confirmed by **SMS** or via the app **Personalkollen**. No contract was signed. No digital document ever materialized.

Twice, I was told a contract would be issued. But at no point did I receive an explanation, a delay notice, or even an apology. It simply **wasn't a priority**.

---

### This wasn’t an oversight — it was a structure

Quan reminded me several times that I was in a **trial period**. This message, repeated subtly, served as a justification for administrative nonchalance.

In restaurants like this one, contracts are often viewed as **bureaucratic dead weight**. They are rarely written for short-term employees in peripheral roles.

Dishwashers rotate quickly. Many don’t ask. Employers know this — and **leverage that silence**.

## ⚖️ Legal annotation

According to the **Swedish Employment Protection Act (LAS)**, an employer must formalize the terms of employment **by day 7**.

The absence of a contract does not nullify the relationship, but it **removes legal proof** for:

- work hours,
- salary terms,
- protections in case of dispute or dismissal.

It also undermines access to **social and municipal support**.

> ☑️ In my case, when I applied for **emergency municipal support** in Malmö, a case officer questioned my legal right to reside in Sweden, simply because I had no contract.

## 🎯 Strategic scope

Not publishing a contract is not a mistake. It’s a **shield** for the employer, and a **trap** for the worker:

- It allows full flexibility on the employer’s end
- It weakens any future legal claim from the employee
- It renders disputes harder to prove or document

## 🔍 Comparative example (to be developed)

In parallel, another restaurant I worked for **did publish a contract** — but it was poorly written, partial, and legally weak.

This shows that the problem may not only be **intentional avoidance**, but also **lack of competence** in drafting proper employment contracts.
