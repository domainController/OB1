    <p class="mb-4">
      I'm Patrice Kenmoé, the creator and maintainer of AfterShift. I document labor conflicts in Sweden, with a focus on the restaurant and hospitality industry.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Based in Malmö, I investigate the legal blind spots that precarious workers face — from missing contracts to denied wages — and explore strategic and legal responses to employer misconduct.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      My work is based on real cases, legal texts, and procedural analysis. AfterShift is both a personal archive and a tactical publishing project.
    </p>
